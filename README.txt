BULLS AND COWS
[text game]

At one point I've looked for a 'bulls and cows' game and didn't find any
portable ones. They were either for POSIX targets only or had heavy GUI
dependencies. So I wrote this one.

The source code is ANSI C and you should be able to compile on pretty much
any platform that has a C compiler.
